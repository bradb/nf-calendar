# nf-calendar - A basic calendar built in pure JavaScript

nf-calendar is one of a series of experiments in building a basic calendaring application in JavaScript with No Frameworks. It's also a place I use to play with different ways of writing JavaScript - OO, functional, procedural, etc.

Once this project reaches a level of basic feature completeness, the goal is to reimplement with progressively more elaborate frameworks (jquery, react, and angular.)
